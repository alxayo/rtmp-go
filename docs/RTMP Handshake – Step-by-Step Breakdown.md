RTMP Handshake ‚Äì Step-by-Step Breakdown
The handshake consists of three main steps involving three messages exchanged between the client and server:
Step 1: C0 + C1 (Client ‚Üí Server)

C0: 1 byte ‚Äì RTMP version (usually 0x03 for version 3).
C1: 1536 bytes ‚Äì Contains:

Timestamp (4 bytes): Time when the message was sent.
Zero field (4 bytes): Reserved.
Random data (1528 bytes): Used for session uniqueness.



Step 2: S0 + S1 + S2 (Server ‚Üí Client)

S0: 1 byte ‚Äì RTMP version (should match C0).
S1: 1536 bytes ‚Äì Similar structure to C1:

Timestamp
Zero field
Random data


S2: 1536 bytes ‚Äì Echoes back the client‚Äôs C1 data to confirm receipt and integrity.

Step 3: C2 (Client ‚Üí Server)

C2: 1536 bytes ‚Äì Echoes back the server‚Äôs S1 data to complete the handshake.

Once this exchange is complete, the connection is established, and the client can begin sending RTMP messages (audio, video, metadata).

üß† Additional Negotiation After Handshake
After the basic handshake, the client and server negotiate:
‚úÖ Version Negotiation

Ensures both sides support the same RTMP version (usually v3).

üì¶ Chunk Size Agreement

RTMP breaks data into chunks (default size: 128 bytes).
The client and server can send a Set Chunk Size message to increase this (e.g., 4096 bytes) for performance.

üì∂ Bandwidth Check

The client sends a Bandwidth Check message.
The server responds with its bandwidth capacity.
Helps optimize streaming quality and avoid buffering.


üîê Security Considerations

RTMP itself is not encrypted.
For secure transmission, RTMPS (RTMP over TLS/SSL) is used.
Authentication can be added via tokens or signed URLs.


Excellent question! The RTMP protocol version commonly referred to as version 3 is actually the version byte used during the handshake process, not a formal versioning system like HTTP/2 or TLS 1.3. However, there are different RTMP handshake versions and modes, each with technical differences that affect compatibility, security, and codec support.
Let‚Äôs break this down precisely:

üî¢ RTMP Version Byte (C0/S0)
During the handshake, the first byte sent by the client (C0) and server (S0) indicates the protocol version:

0x03 ‚Üí RTMP version 3 (standard, most widely used)
0x06 ‚Üí RTMPE (Adobe's encrypted variant)
0x08 ‚Üí RTMPS (RTMP over SSL/TLS)

These are not protocol versions in the traditional sense, but indicators of the handshake mode and encryption type.

üß© RTMP Handshake Modes
There are two main handshake types:
1. Simple Handshake (Standard RTMP v3)

Used by: Most encoders (OBS, FFmpeg, FMLE), servers (nginx-rtmp, Wowza).
Structure:

C0/S0: 1 byte (version, usually 0x03)
C1/S1: 1536 bytes

4 bytes: timestamp
4 bytes: zero field
1528 bytes: random data


C2/S2: 1536 bytes

Echoes the peer‚Äôs random data




Purpose: Establishes a basic session with no encryption.
Codec Support: VP6, MP3, Speex (Flash-era codecs).


2. Complex Handshake (Encrypted RTMP)

Used by: Adobe Flash Player, RTMPE/RTMPS servers.
Structure:

C1/S1: Includes digest and key blocks for cryptographic verification.
Two schemas:

Schema 0: Key first, digest second.
Schema 1: Digest first, key second.




Cryptography:

Uses HMAC-SHA256 for digest verification.
Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
RC4 stream cipher for encryption.


Purpose: Adds DRM and secure session establishment.
Codec Support: H.264, AAC (modern codecs).
Version bytes:

C1[4‚Äì7] and S1[4‚Äì7] contain version identifiers (e.g., 0x80 00 07 02 or 0x04 05 00 01). [Rtmp proto...) detailed]




üÜï Enhanced RTMP (E-RTMP)

Introduced by: Veovera Software Organization (2023+).
Not a handshake version, but an extension of RTMP capabilities.
Enhancements:

Multitrack support (multiple audio/video tracks).
Advanced codecs: VP9, HEVC, AV1, Opus, FLAC.
FourCC signaling for codec identification.
Reconnect request feature.
Nanosecond timestamp precision.


Compatibility: Backward-compatible with RTMP v3 handshake
