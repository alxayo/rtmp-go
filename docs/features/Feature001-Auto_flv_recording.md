# Feature 001: Automatic FLV Recording

## Date
October 11, 2025

## Status
✅ **IMPLEMENTED AND COMPLETE**

## Overview

Implemented automatic FLV recording functionality for the RTMP server. When enabled via command-line flag, the server now records all incoming streams to disk in FLV format with timestamped filenames.

---

## Problem Statement

### Initial Request
User started the RTMP server with:
```powershell
.\rtmp-server.exe -listen localhost:1935 -log-level debug -record-all true -record-dir ./
```

User asked: *"Review the code in this repo and let me know where and how the incoming media stream packets are recorded"*

### Discovery
After comprehensive code review, found that:
1. ✅ **Recorder infrastructure existed** (`internal/rtmp/media/recorder.go`)
2. ✅ **Server config accepted flags** (`-record-all`, `-record-dir`)
3. ❌ **Recording was NOT wired up** - media packets were only logged, never written to FLV
4. ❌ **Recorder never instantiated** - no `NewRecorder()` calls found
5. ❌ **Media flow stopped at logging** - packets dropped after `MediaLogger.ProcessMessage()`

### Root Cause
The recorder implementation from Task T045 was completed but never integrated with the server's media message flow. The flags were parsed but never used.

---

## Solution

### Implementation Strategy

Followed the architectural plan:
1. Pass server config to command integration layer
2. Create recorder when publisher starts streaming
3. Write media packets to recorder alongside logging
4. Clean up recorders on disconnect/shutdown

### Files Modified

#### 1. `internal/rtmp/server/command_integration.go` (+85 lines)

**Changes:**
- Added `streamKey string` field to `commandState` to track active publishing stream
- Modified `attachCommandHandling(c, reg, log)` → `attachCommandHandling(c, reg, cfg, log)`
- Updated `OnPublish` handler to initialize recorder if `cfg.RecordAll == true`
- Modified media message handler to write packets to recorder
- Added imports: `fmt`, `os`, `path/filepath`, `strings`, `media`

**New Functions:**
```go
// initRecorder creates FLV recorder with timestamped filename
func initRecorder(stream *Stream, recordDir string, log *slog.Logger) error

// cleanupRecorder closes recorder and releases resources
func cleanupRecorder(reg *Registry, streamKey string, log *slog.Logger)
```

**Media Message Flow (Updated):**
```go
if m.TypeID == 8 || m.TypeID == 9 {
    st.mediaLogger.ProcessMessage(m)  // Log statistics
    
    // NEW: Write to recorder if recording is active
    if st.streamKey != "" {
        stream := reg.GetStream(st.streamKey)
        if stream != nil && stream.Recorder != nil {
            stream.Recorder.WriteMessage(m)
        }
    }
    
    return
}
```

#### 2. `internal/rtmp/server/server.go` (+37 lines)

**Changes:**
- Updated `attachCommandHandling()` call to pass `&s.cfg` parameter
- Modified `Stop()` method to call `cleanupAllRecorders()` before shutdown
- Added `cleanupAllRecorders()` method to iterate all streams and close recorders

**New Method:**
```go
// cleanupAllRecorders closes all active recorders in the registry
func (s *Server) cleanupAllRecorders() {
    // Iterate streams, close recorders, log results
}
```

## Technical Details

### Recording Lifecycle

#### 1. Initialization (OnPublish)
```
Client sends publish command
    ↓
HandlePublish() registers publisher
    ↓
Check cfg.RecordAll flag
    ↓
Create recordings directory (os.MkdirAll)
    ↓
Generate filename: {streamkey}_{timestamp}.flv
    ↓
media.NewRecorder(filepath, logger)
    ↓
Store in stream.Recorder
    ↓
Log: "recording started"
```

#### 2. Active Recording (Media Messages)
```
Audio/Video packet arrives (TypeID 8 or 9)
    ↓
MediaLogger.ProcessMessage() → statistics
    ↓
stream.Recorder.WriteMessage() → FLV tag
    ↓
Write: [Tag Header (11 bytes) + Payload + PreviousTagSize (4 bytes)]
```

#### 3. Cleanup (Disconnect/Shutdown)
```
Publisher disconnects OR Server.Stop() called
    ↓
cleanupAllRecorders() or cleanupRecorder()
    ↓
recorder.Close()
    ↓
Flush buffers, close file handle
    ↓
stream.Recorder = nil
    ↓
Log: "recorder closed"
```

### File Naming Convention

**Pattern:** `{stream_key}_{timestamp}.flv`

**Examples:**
- `live_test_20251011_140052.flv`
- `app_stream_20251011_143022.flv`
- `live_mystream_20251011_150230.flv`

**Implementation:**
```go
safeKey := strings.ReplaceAll(stream.Key, "/", "_")  // Replace slashes
timestamp := time.Now().Format("20060102_150405")     // YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
filename := fmt.Sprintf("%s_%s.flv", safeKey, timestamp)
```

### FLV File Structure

#### Header (13 bytes)
```
Bytes 0-2:  "FLV" (signature)
Byte 3:     0x01 (version)
Byte 4:     0x05 (flags: audio + video enabled)
Bytes 5-8:  0x00000009 (header length, big-endian)
Bytes 9-12: 0x00000000 (PreviousTagSize0)
```

#### Tags (repeated for each audio/video packet)
```
Byte 0:     Tag Type (0x08=audio, 0x09=video)
Bytes 1-3:  Data Size (24-bit big-endian)
Bytes 4-6:  Timestamp lower 24 bits
Byte 7:     Timestamp extended (upper 8 bits)
Bytes 8-10: Stream ID (0x000000)
Bytes 11+:  Tag Data (audio/video payload)
Last 4:     PreviousTagSize (11 + data size)
```

## Configuration

### Command-Line Flags

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `-record-all` | bool | `false` | Enable recording for all streams |
| `-record-dir` | string | `"recordings"` | Directory for FLV files |
| `-listen` | string | `":1935"` | Server listen address |
| `-log-level` | string | `"info"` | Log level (debug/info/warn/error) |

### Usage Examples

**Basic:**
```powershell
.\rtmp-server.exe -record-all true
```

**Custom directory:**
```powershell
.\rtmp-server.exe -record-all true -record-dir C:\recordings
```

**With debug logging:**
```powershell
.\rtmp-server.exe -record-all true -record-dir ./recordings -log-level debug
```

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

**Philosophy:** Recording failures should NOT affect live streaming.

**Behavior:**
- Error occurs → Log error message
- Recorder disabled → Set `stream.Recorder = nil`
- Live stream continues → Publishers/subscribers unaffected
- Future packets → Silently skipped (recorder is nil)

**Scenarios:**
1. **Disk Full** - Recording stops, stream continues
2. **Permission Denied** - Recorder not created, stream continues
3. **I/O Error** - Recorder closed, stream continues
4. **Directory Creation Failed** - Recording disabled, stream continues

### Thread Safety

**Recorder:**
- Uses `sync.Mutex` internally
- `WriteMessage()` is non-blocking
- Safe for single-goroutine use (message handler)

**Stream Registry:**
- `sync.RWMutex` protects stream map
- Per-stream `mu sync.RWMutex` for recorder field
- Safe concurrent access across connections

**Server:**
- `sync.RWMutex` for connection map
- Cleanup uses read lock + iteration
- No deadlocks (proper lock ordering)

## Testing

### Manual Test Procedure

**Terminal 1: Start Server**
```powershell
.\rtmp-server.exe -listen localhost:1935 -log-level info -record-all true -record-dir ./recordings
```

**Terminal 2: Publish Stream**
```powershell
ffmpeg -re -i test.mp4 -c copy -f flv rtmp://localhost:1935/live/test
```

**Terminal 3: Verify Recording**
```powershell
# List files
ls ./recordings

# Check metadata
ffprobe recordings\live_test_*.flv

# Playback
ffplay recordings\live_test_*.flv
```

## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **No Metadata Tag** - FLV files lack onMetaData script tag
   - Impact: Metadata missing (duration, width, height, codecs)
   - Workaround: Files still playable

2. **No File Rotation** - Single file per stream session
   - Impact: Large files for long streams
   - Workaround: None currently

3. **No Resume After Error** - Recording cannot resume once stopped
   - Impact: Partial recordings if error occurs
   - Workaround: Monitor disk space

4. **Timestamp Precision** - 1-second resolution
   - Impact: Possible filename collisions (same stream, same second)
   - Likelihood: Very low in practice

5. **All or Nothing** - No per-stream recording control
   - Impact: Cannot selectively record specific streams
   - Workaround: Use `-record-all false` and implement custom logic

### Not Implemented (Future Work)

- [ ] Per-stream recording control (config file or API)
- [ ] Disk space monitoring (auto-stop on low space)
- [ ] File size/duration limits (auto-rotation)
- [ ] HLS output alongside FLV
- [ ] MP4 muxing option
- [ ] Cloud upload (S3/Azure/GCS)
- [ ] Thumbnail generation
- [ ] Recording API (start/stop via HTTP)
- [ ] Admin dashboard
- [ ] Recording statistics endpoint

---

## Future Enhancements

### Short-Term (High Priority)

1. **Add onMetaData Tag**
   - Write FLV script data tag with stream metadata
   - Include: duration, width, height, videodatarate, audiodatarate, etc.
   - Priority: High (improves compatibility)

2. **Per-Stream Recording Control**
   - Config file: `recordings.json` with stream whitelist
   - Or: REST API endpoint to start/stop recording
   - Priority: High (user requirement)

3. **Disk Space Monitoring**
   - Check available space before creating recorder
   - Auto-stop recording if space < threshold (e.g., 1GB)
   - Priority: Medium (prevents disk full)

### Medium-Term

4. **File Rotation**
   - Max file size limit (e.g., 1GB)
   - Max duration limit (e.g., 1 hour)
   - Segment naming: `{streamkey}_{timestamp}_part{N}.flv`
   - Priority: Medium (large file handling)

5. **Recording API**
   - HTTP endpoint: `POST /api/recording/{streamkey}/start`
   - HTTP endpoint: `POST /api/recording/{streamkey}/stop`
   - HTTP endpoint: `GET /api/recordings` (list)
   - Priority: Medium (dynamic control)

6. **Millisecond Timestamps**
   - Format: `20060102_150405_999`
   - Prevents filename collisions
   - Priority: Low (edge case)

### Long-Term

7. **HLS Output** - Generate HLS playlist alongside FLV
8. **MP4 Muxing** - Option to write MP4 instead of FLV
9. **Cloud Upload** - Automatic upload to S3/Azure/GCS after recording
10. **Thumbnail Generation** - Extract keyframes as JPEG thumbnails
11. **Admin Dashboard** - Web UI for managing recordings
12. **Recording Statistics** - Metrics endpoint (duration, size, bitrate)
