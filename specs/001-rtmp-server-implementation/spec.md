# Feature Specification: RTMP Server Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `001-rtmp-server-implementation`  
**Created**: October 1, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "RTMP server implementation with handshake, chunking, and basic streaming support"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: Codec Handling Strategy - Should the server validate specific codecs or operate as codec-agnostic relay? ‚Üí A: Hybrid - Server accepts any codec but logs/reports codec information for monitoring purposes
- Q: Maximum Concurrent Connections - What is the target maximum number of simultaneous client connections the server should support? ‚Üí A: 10-50 connections (Small-scale development/testing environment)
- Q: Target Latency - What is the acceptable end-to-end latency from publisher to player? ‚Üí A: 3-5 seconds (Relaxed latency for easier buffering and stability)
- Q: Authentication Mechanism - How should the server authenticate clients? ‚Üí A: No authentication (Accept all connections, suitable for development/testing in trusted networks)
- Q: Stream Recording - Should the server support recording published streams to disk? ‚Üí A: Yes, optional (Recording can be enabled/disabled per stream or via configuration)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A content creator uses streaming software (e.g., OBS Studio) to broadcast live video to an RTMP server. The server accepts the connection, receives the audio/video stream, and makes it available for viewers to watch in real-time using media players.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Publisher Connect and Publish**
   - **Given** the RTMP server is running and listening
   - **When** a streaming client connects with valid stream credentials
   - **Then** the server completes the RTMP handshake and accepts the connection

2. **Stream Ingestion**
   - **Given** a publisher is connected
   - **When** the publisher sends audio and video data
   - **Then** the server receives, processes, and stores the stream for distribution

3. **Player Connect and Playback**
   - **Given** an active published stream exists
   - **When** a player client requests to play that stream
   - **Then** the server begins transmitting the stream data to the player within 3-5 seconds

4. **Multiple Concurrent Streams**
   - **Given** the server is running
   - **When** multiple publishers broadcast different streams simultaneously
   - **Then** each stream is handled independently without interference

5. **Stream Disconnection**
   - **Given** a publisher or player is connected
   - **When** the client disconnects (gracefully or abruptly)
   - **Then** the server cleans up resources and notifies affected parties

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a publisher loses network connectivity mid-stream?
- How does the system handle when a player requests a non-existent stream?
- What occurs if a client sends malformed RTMP messages?
- How does the server behave when receiving data faster than it can process?
- What happens when multiple publishers attempt to publish to the same stream key?
- How does the system handle version mismatches during handshake?

## Next Steps

Before proceeding to the planning phase:

1. **Clarify codec handling**: Determine if server should be codec-agnostic (transparent relay) or support specific codecs with validation
2. **Define scale targets**: Specify maximum concurrent connections, streams, and target latency
3. **Confirm security requirements**: Decide on authentication, authorization, and rate limiting needs
4. **Determine recording scope**: Clarify if stream recording is included in this feature
5. **Specify monitoring approach**: Define metrics and observability requirements
6. **Confirm RTMPS support**: Decide if secure transport is needed in this iteration
7. **Clarify error handling policies**: Define retry behavior and disconnection strategies
8. **Set memory constraints**: Specify per-connection and total memory limits

Once these clarifications are provided, the specification can be marked as final and the feature can proceed to the planning phase for detailed technical design and task breakdown.
