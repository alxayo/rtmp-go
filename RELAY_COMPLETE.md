# RTMP Relay - Final Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE AND WORKING**

---

## üéâ Success!

The RTMP relay functionality is now **fully operational**:

‚úÖ **Recording** works (FLV files)  
‚úÖ **Relay** works (live streaming to subscribers)  
‚úÖ **Simultaneous operation** works (both at the same time)  
‚úÖ **Late-joining subscribers** receive codec initialization and play correctly

---

## Problem ‚Üí Solution

### Initial Issue
```
‚ùå ffplay: [h264] No start code is found
‚ùå ffplay: [h264] Error splitting the input into NAL units  
‚ùå Video did not play
```

### Root Cause
**Late-joining subscribers missed codec initialization packets (H.264 SPS/PPS, AAC AudioSpecificConfig)**

- OBS sent sequence headers at stream start (timestamp 0)
- ffplay connected 43 seconds later
- ffplay received media packets but never got sequence headers
- H.264 decoder failed to initialize

### Solution Implemented
**Cache sequence headers and send to new subscribers**

1. Added `AudioSequenceHeader` and `VideoSequenceHeader` fields to `Stream` struct
2. Modified `BroadcastMessage()` to detect and cache sequence headers
3. Modified `HandlePlay()` to send cached headers to new subscribers

### Result
```
‚úÖ Server logs: "Cached audio/video sequence header"
‚úÖ Server logs: "Sent cached audio/video sequence header to subscriber"  
‚úÖ ffplay: Video plays successfully
‚úÖ User confirms: "relay was working as I can see a windows with the media being streamed"
```

## Test Results

### Server Logs (Success)
```json
INFO: Cached audio sequence header | size=7
INFO: Cached video sequence header | size=52
INFO: Subscriber added | total_subscribers=1
INFO: Sent cached audio sequence header to subscriber
INFO: Sent cached video sequence header to subscriber
```

### FFplay Output (Success)
```
Stream #0:0: Audio: aac (LC), 48000 Hz, stereo, fltp
Stream #0:1: Video: h264 (High), yuv420p, 1280x720, 30.30 fps
[h264] mmco: unref short failure  ‚Üê Expected (see below)
```

## About "mmco: unref short failure"

### What It Is
- **MMCO** = Memory Management Control Operation (H.264 reference frame management)
- Appears when subscriber joins **mid-GOP** (between keyframes)
- Decoder cannot find referenced frame, discards it, waits for next keyframe

### Severity: ‚ö†Ô∏è COSMETIC (NON-CRITICAL)

**Evidence**:
- Appears **once** (not repeated)
- Video plays successfully
- No cascade of errors
- Industry-standard behavior (YouTube, Twitch, etc.)

### Fix Required? ‚ùå NO

**Recommendation**: **Accept as-is**

This is expected behavior when joining a live H.264 stream mid-GOP. The decoder recovers automatically within < 1 second.

**See**: `RELAY_MMCO_ERROR_ANALYSIS.md` for detailed analysis

## Usage

### Start Server
```powershell
.\rtmp-server.exe -listen localhost:1935 -log-level info -record-all true -record-dir ./recordings
```

### Publish (OBS)
```
rtmp://localhost:1935/live/test
```

### Subscribe (ffplay)
```powershell
ffplay rtmp://localhost:1935/live/test
```

### Play Recording
```powershell
ffplay recordings\live_test_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.flv
```
